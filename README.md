# BattleshipHamon
Battleship was created as a guessing game. Tough guessing can be more logical, as I have tried to implement
into some of my code. Using a variety of methods, I hope to simplify the tester (though still not simple!) more than if I 
were to just put all my code in there. Setting a blueprint for other modes in this game has been laid out. I am confident
that if I were to do a slower or even faster game that it wouldnt take me too much longer, as I already have code to plug
it into.
